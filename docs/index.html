# Tempest Weather WallGauge

This WallGauge displays weather data from your home Tempest weather station.  The data is pulled from the WeatherFlow API (that is where your Tempest uploads its weather data)

## Deeper Dive

The Tempest Weather WallGauge is a collection of four gauges on one gauge face.  Each gauge has a unique data source and are all sourced from the [WeatherFlow Smart Weather API](https://weatherflow.github.io/SmartWeather/api/#object-model).  I have created a node.js data delegate called the [weatherFlowDataGetter](https://github.com/WallGauge-GaugeApps/weatherFlowDataGetter/blob/master/README.md) that makes the API calls and returns the data to this gauge app. The weather Flow Data Getter and this gauge app are open source library’s and you're welcome to improve or use these library’s in your own projects.
